# SWOW-eval
This project describes a new task for evaluating pre-trained word embeddings. In particular, we present the intrinsic evaluation task originally named **SWOW-8500**, and employs a large word association dataset called the [Small World of Words (SWOW)](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/). 

This repository also serves as the go-to page regarding our paper titled *"SWOW-8500: Word Association Task for Intrinsic Evaluation of Word Embeddings"*, accepted at the [RepEval2019](https://repeval2019.github.io/index) workshop, collocated with the 2019 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics ([NAACL 2019](https://naacl2019.org) June 2â€“7, 2019, at Minneapolis, United States.

## The Gist

## Word Associations

Word Association games are those wherein a participant is asked to utter the first (or first few) words that occur to him/her when given a trigger/cue/stimulus word. For example, given the cue KING, one could respond with RULE, QUEEN, KINGDOM, or even KONG (from the movie King Kong). Word associations have long intrigued psychologists including Carl Jung and hence large studies have been conducted in this direction. Some prominent datasets which collect user responses to word association games are:<br>

* [USF-FA](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/dic/fa/FreeAssoc.htm): University of Southern Florida Free Association norms have single-word association responses from an average of 149 participants per cue for a set of 5,019 cue words.
* [EAT](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/rali/?q=en/Textual%20Resources/EAT): Edinburgh Association Thesaurus collects 100 responses per cue for a total of 8,400 cues. 
* [JeuxDeMots](http://www.jeuxdemots.org/jdm-accueil.php): is a crowdsourced game which has collected over 5 million french word associations so far. 
* **[SWOW (Small World of Words)](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project)**: lists word association and participant data for 100 primary, secondary and tertiary responses to 12,292 cues, collected from over 90,000 participants. 
* [Birkbeck norms](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=loDxzOXCRlYC&printsec=frontcover): contain 40 to 50 responses for over 2,600 cues in British English.
